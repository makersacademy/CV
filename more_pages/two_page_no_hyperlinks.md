I am a junior software developer and graduate of Makers Academy\
My background combines the hard-working logical thoroughness of working in 
pharmaceutical research with experience of customer service and working to client demands.\
I'm looking for a back-end focussed role where I can continue to develop my technical ability and the problem-solving and teamworking skills that I used during the bootcamp.
I'm very excited about how the world of tech has created so many new ways to improve the lives of people all around the world. From large-scale ecological projects benefiting the natural world to the fact that banking is now a bit easier; real people are seeing real advantages based on the work of developers everywhere.

### <u>Hobbies</u>
I like to contrast my busy tech work-life with stepping away from the screen and keyboard in my leisure time. A lot of what I do for fun could be described as traditional or old-fashioned. I also enjoy learning lots of information about a diverse range of subjects, so when something interests me I am likely to find something to read about it.
