|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|[Bites game][bites-gh]|A playable clone of the existing tabletop game ['Bites'][bites-bgt]. Playable through the command line and copies the logic used in the game in a clean test-driven Python app. |Python|Python's built-in testing framework: [unittest][python-unittest].|Test-driven development (TDD), single responsibility principle (SRP) and object-oriented programming (OOP).|
|[Deep Sea Adventure game][deep-sea-adventure-gh]|A playable clone of the existing tabletop game ['Deep Sea Adventure'][deep-sea-adventure-oink] Playable through the command line and copies the logic used in the game. Uses lessons learned during the Bites project.|Python|Python's built-in testing framework: [unittest][python-unittest].|Learning from previous experience. Refining skills in TDD, SRP and OOP.|
|[Project Euler][project-euler-gh]|My work on the popular web-based series of mathematical/coding challenges; [Project Euler][project-euler]. Each challenge has its own README explaining how it was approached.|Python|Not test-driven; any testing was done by 'feature tests' and visually inspecting practice outputs.|Planning my work, problem solving, reporting progress. Memoisation. Code reviewing.|
|[Makers Algorithm Workshop][algorithm-workshop-gh]|My work on the Algorithmic Complexity workshop run by Makers Academy post-bootcamp. Where I developed a basic understanding of algorithmic time complexity and how to think about optimising my code.|Ruby|Not test-driven; any testing was done by 'feature tests' and visually inspecting practice outputs.|OOP, optimisation and recursion. Basic understanding of big-O classification.|
|[Operation Green Grid][green-grid-gh]|Something I made for my own amusement. A 'commit-bot' which, if left running, will push commits to my GitHub account at random intervals.|Python|Not test-driven; any testing was done by 'feature tests' and visually inspecting practice outputs.|Sending instructions to the command line, spiking, and ad-hoc learning during code production.|
