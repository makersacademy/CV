## Jennifer Hanratty

Junior Software Developer looking for first full-time technical role in an agile environment.

#### How I chose this path

After taking time out to be at home with 3 awesome little people and realising that the roles I had previously didn't interest me as they once had, I decided to shake things up a bit.

It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do. I love learning; I love maths and figuring out problems.

I began my coding journey almost accidentally. I did some maths courses online and this led me to some coding courses. It was only after messing around with code for a few months, talking to people and attending meet-ups that I realised that this was something I wanted to do full-time.

I am currently enrolled in the Makers Academy Remote course, 90% at level complete of re-skilling myself completely.

I am also involved with [Django Girls Belfast](https://djangogirls.org/belfast/), who provide one-day workshops to women who want to learn to build their own web apps using Python and Django. There is an incredible demand for this workshop - every time we run it we increase our numbers of applicants. It's amazing!

#### What I am

* Incredibly motivated to learn all that I can get my hands on.
* Curious about how the world works and what I can do to contribute to it.
* Organised & practical. 3 small children + Makers Academy === a need to be completely organised all of the time!

I have a [blog](https://medium.com/@hanratty.jen) that is updated regularly. And you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-hanratty-6977b8109).

## What I have gotten out of Makers Academy


#### Skills

Got lots of awesome new skills. My coding skills have jumped massively in the past 3 months, as well as my ability to learn. How I approach new problems and how I can communicate those to other people has improved so much and I'm much more comfortable expressing my ideas.

In week 9, our group of 6 decided to build a test-driven [blogging platform](#projects) using Django and Python even though our combined experience was minimal. In 5 days we managed to build something to be proud of with a lot of potential. This increased our confidence immensely and we can now see that we do have that ability to move between different languages, which is amazing!

Now that I know what can be done in only a few days, I'm very excited to see what I can achieve in the next 6 weeks, 6 months and 6 years.

#### Focus

I had been self-taught before I was accepted on the Makers Academy course. I had been learning for almost a year before I started, using a mixture of online resources such as Treehouse, Pluralsight, Code Academy, Khan Academy, and tech books.

I found however that the more I learned, the more I could see how much there actually was out there and I found myself going too many directions, not really knowing the best path to follow.

Whilst I know that there is no set *best* path to follow, Makers Academy did enable me to refine my learning, provided disciple and focus to my learning and provided the best possible way for me to continue post-course on my own.

#### New relationships

I've met so many new people from Makers Academy. Pre-course, I assumed that because I was a remote student, this would be quite a solitary experience. But I was incredibly wrong.

The use of XP practices meant that we were assigned a new pair partner every single day. This was quite a daunting thought at the start of the course but it is something that I really got a lot out of and I think it helped progress our learning a lot more than if we were on our own.

#### Hack the Hub event September 2016
* Our group of 4 spent the day building a web application called [Volunteer Me](https://hth-volunteer.herokuapp.com/) to make Belfast better. We made use of Open Data NI to build a social network that could bring together volunteers and charities in a fun way and make better use of the amazing people that live in Northern Ireland. This was a fun and eye-opening day. Being surrounded by so much talent was really great and provided a lot of inspiration as to the type of developer I would like to become.
