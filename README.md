## Skills for the job

#### Web Developer

A fast learner of new technologies who thoroughly enjoys being challenged.

* Ruby on Rails:
  - Fullstack developer at Zopa implementing a Rails web app in Ruby, Postgres, CSS/HTML, Docker, Git and Redis/Sidekiq.
* Javascript, C#.net experience on smaller projects.
* Testing and TDD:
  - Exceptional attention to detail from 9 years of Software Testing in the construction of test scenarios. Coding example with Rspec tests  [best-rate loan matcher](https://github.com/meads58/best_rate)
  - Strong TDD culture at Zopa and used Rspec and BDD with Capybara for testing. Set up tests to run in Jenkins as regression tests for Continuous Integration of all pushed code.
* DevOps:
  - Implemented Docker containers for the deployment of our the Debt Collection application at Zopa.
  - Working on a deployment solution using Docker, Vagrant, Octopus, Jenkins and Artifactory tools. This will allow for a quick spin up of identical environments on any machine and the removal of bottlenecks in the current deployment process.

#### Communication

Excellent, clear and concise communication skills.

* Pair programming:
  - Used at Zopa to quickly build up knowledge of the system code base and for reviewing code which successfully speeded up the release process.
* Business and Developer communication:
  - Excellent skills at bridging the communication gap between business and technical audiences form the years spent as a tester liaising between developers and business users.
* Question asking:
  - Not afraid to ask for clarification early on which helps set focus to solve the correct problems.

#### Problem Solving

Skills to break down problems into manageable chunks, attention to detail and designing solutions that integrate well.

* Define the problem:
  - Define the problem, break it down and look for any potential issues downstream. At Zopa created a process flow diagram after talking to the business owner and shared this with the team for feedback. This was then used as the wireframe for the actual system.
* Innovation:
  -  Looking to improve/refactor code for a genuine benefit. Example at Zopa with an opportunity to add needed flexibility of the 'on hold' feature. Instead of a solution to pause the Sidekiq queue, the queue time was made adjustable. This gave the users added flexibility for individual cases and also allowed them to simulate a full work flow in UAT.
* Planning and Design:
  - The [Battleship project](https://github.com/meads58/battleships/tree/master/lib)  project shows how the single responsibility principle was used to design the system. Achieved a clear understanding of building applications up from small manageable chunks to solve a specific problem led to making, maintaining and adding features easier.
