Full-stack developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy. I have taught myself 4 languages in the past 4 months and I pride myself on writing code that is both clean and readable. During my intensive journey into web development, I had found a deep appreciation for Test Driven Development, Object Orientated Programming and XP values.

Prior to Makers Academy I obtained experience in a diverse range of roles in a variety of countries. My experiences span journalism in Italy to managing a startup in Australia.

## Projects

| Project &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| Description | Tech Stack  | Testing |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Swift Exit](https://github.com/habin-isa/Angelos) | This was my final project. It is a mobile application that has the functionality to send emergency texts, make fake phone calls and put users in touch with support lines, all whilst under disguise as the home screen. I was heavily focussed on the backend i.e. building the models and testing. It took two weeks to complete. | Swift Twilio Alamofire Xcode Core-Libraries | XCT |
| [Gilded Rose Tech-Test](https://github.com/muzzi92/Gilded_Rose_Tech_Test) | Completed during Tech Test week at Makers. This was a debugging and refactoring challenge, where some legacy code had to be cleaned up, extracted and tested. It took 3 days to finish. | Ruby | Rspec |
| [Bank   Tech-Test](https://github.com/muzzi92/BankTechTest)  | I completed this challenge during Week 10 Tech Test challenges. It has been built in line with a given spec, and follows both DRY and SRP principles. It took 2 days to complete.  | JavaScript  | Jasmine  |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/Possed/Acebook-Blunicorn)  | This was a group engineering project in which we had to develop a website with some of the functionality of Facebook. I worked on post and comment features. I encountered the most challenges on this project, but learnt a lot from some mistakes. It took two weeks to complete. | Java Spring Maven Heroku PostgreSQL React Node  | JUnit Cypress  |   



## Skills

#### Fast, Independent Learner

* 4 languages (and their associated stacks) in 4 months.

Having only stepped foot into programming in February 2018, I like to think that I have come a long way. After teaching myself some basic Python syntax, I moved on to an online, full-stack JavaScript course. On completion, I jumped straight into Makers where I have improved my JavaScript as well as picked up Ruby, Java, Swift and their associated stacks.

#### TDD

I am a strong advocate of Test Driven Development. Creating tests based on user stories is a fantastic way of ensuring specifications are always satisfied. On top of that, writing robust and mutable code means that I can contribute to solid code bases with high longevity. I have test driven all my applications at Makers, and have even created a [testing framework](https://github.com/ZoeKavanagh/mr_jazz_framework) for JavaScript.

#### Communication

Aside from studying communications at university, I have practiced it extensively both inside and outside of work. Working in sales required a way with words and an ability to connect with people, whilst travelling the world alone for 18 months required confidence and the ability to engage with new people on a daily basis.

## Experience

**Helping Humans** (January 2017 to December 2017)    
*Regional Business Development Manager*   
I was given the opportunity to bring this Melbourne based startup drinks supplier to the Sydney market. I secured 90 new stockists in the first six months of operation. Initially I was working on my own before hiring and training staff.

**Pets Corner** (September 2015 to May 2016)   
*Branch Manager*  
I originally took this role as a stepping stone before going travelling. However after 2 weeks on the job they promoted me to manager and gave me a brand new shop.
During my time at the shop sales of target goods went from 0% to 75% of total sales.

**Mello Drinks** (June 2015 to September 2015)  
*Intern*   
Managed social media channels and created content for this startup drinks company.

**StudentsVille Italia** (January 2013 to May 2013)  
*Intern*   
Created videos, wrote articles and updated websites for this online student hub in Florence.

**ETA Florence Renewable Energies** (September 2012 to January 2013)  
*Intern*   
Wrote articles and helped organise events for this European conference company.

## Interests
**Travel**   
I have travelled to around 30 different countries so far and I am always looking for the opportunity to see somewhere new. Different cultures, exciting adventures and new cuisine are the major pulls for me. Japan is next on my list.

**Film**   
I attend film club meet-ups when I can and enjoy going to fun events such as secret showings and outdoor cinemas.

**Hiking**  
Have you ever seen a developer in hiking boots and short shorts? Find me up a fell on Sunday mornings and you can find out why 95% of passersby experience nausea.
