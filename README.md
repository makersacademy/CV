## Tom Coakes

I'm a huge coding enthusiast with a semi-useful Linguistics degree from the University of Kent. I have several years of commercial experience in a number of industries, during which time I've made enough wrong decisions to now know how to make the right ones. More than anything else, I'm looking for a company that will help me to continue my journey of learning and allow me to make valuable contributions within a team that 'clicks'.

## Skills

#### Ruby/Rails

As my first programming language, Ruby will always have a special place in my heart. I love the syntactic sugar, but what I enjoy most is the thriving global community.

- Previously the in-house designer at Just IT Training and Recruitment, responsible for all print and web material.

#### JavaScript Ecosystem

I've begun to explore the worlds of client-side and server-side JavaScript but feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what's possible. I'm excited to experiment with up and coming frameworks, as well as build something in node with a websockets library.

- Previously the in-house designer at Just IT Training and Recruitment, responsible for all print and web material.

#### Design

Have an appreciation for clean and effective design that is as functional as it is beautiful. I'm not the most technically proficient designer, but I have a good eye for what works and what doesn't.

- Previously the in-house designer at Just IT Training and Recruitment, responsible for all print and web material.
- Experienced at using Adobe Creative Suite to produce easily maintainable branding or mockups for web/mobile sites.
- Designed the front-ends of both [Journeats](http://journeats.com) and [STEMettes Royalty Loyalty app](http://stemettes-staging.herokuapp.com) (designed for mobile devices)

#### Copywriting and blogging

Developed my writing style at university and learned to apply it within both B2B and B2C contexts whilst working as a marketing executive and chief copywriter.

- Through personally managing and writing the applications for several awards and accreditations, my previous company were shortlisted for Great Place to Work, REC Awards and Sunday Times Top 100 Companies.
