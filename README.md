An alumnus of Makers, I am a film music composer that got seduced by the logic and power of programming.
Through my carrier, I have growth a ability to produced and deliver work under commission,
designing a product that fits the client requirements. Looking for a backend junior developer roll,
in a company where I can grow my skills a software engineer, I am exited about joining a work environment
of collaboration, discipline and respect, willing to contribute to build elegant and efficient code.

## Skills

#### Creativity
I have 15 years of experience creating and producing music for film. Creativity, combined with a precise
understanding of the client requirements, plus advanced technical skills, are essential keys for working on
this industry. For me, creativity is the ability to come up with a new idea, to be able to look at something
in a new way. This ability applied to the world of software development, can help organisations to move in
a more productive direction, adding value to a company.

 - Composed and produced more than 400 commissioned pieces of music for feature film, tv and advertisement.
 - Theatrical text writing contribution for 'Senza Sangue', adaptation of the novel by Alessandro Baricco.   

#### Ability to work under pressure
Through my experience of working for the film industry, I am confident in getting the work done within tight
deadlines. Particularly in the advertisement industry, the deadlines use to be really close, and force you to think and react quickly, requiring high standards of technical skills. In my case, this process has
involved a constant revision about what can be improved in order to make the work better and faster.
Having a clear understanding of the client requirements, and developing technical skills in order to apply
ideas into a practical level, are two essential keys to succeed on this context.

#### Eager to learn
I am a passionate of learning. Apart of had spent 7 years full time at university studying music and theatre,
I am untiringly studying new subjects that interest me, such as music orchestration, music counterpoint,
piano playing, yoga, meditation and currently software development.
