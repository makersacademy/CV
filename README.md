#### Me at a glance

Aspiring junior developer; amateur background in developing video-game plugins (+7 years); professional background in healthcare advertising (+5 years). Recently graduated from the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) bootcamp; excited to join a friendly, ambitious team that will support me as I continue to grow and improve as a developer.

#### How I got here

Through my self-taught hobby of developing video game plugins (aka mods), I discovered a love for wrestling with a programming language to make my ideas a reality. Disatisfied with healthcare advertising, I left my Account Director role in 2021 to develop my hobby-acquired skills into a more fulfilling, stimulating and challenging career in software development.

After several months of self-directed learning, I joined [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) to improve my amateur coding skills for use in a professional context, and to learn new skills and langauages to make me a desirable candidate for a future employer. I am now ready for a junior developer role. I am determined and hungry for the challenge, and I am so excited to get started.

### Featured Makers Challenges

During my time at Makers Academy, I completed several pair-programming and solo challenges. The ones I found particularly educational and enjoyable are listed here.
| Name | Aim | Description | Tech/Tools |
|--|--|--|--|
| [**Acebook**](https://github.com/Zimmja/acebook-blue-magpies) | Group engineering challenge: use a framework to develop a full-stack web-app | A simple social media web-app based on Facebook which allowed users to create a basic profile and comment on other users' profiles | Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, PostgreSQL, Rspec, Rubocop, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Heroku|
| [**Banking**](https://github.com/Zimmja/Makers-challenge-Bank) | Solo technical challenge: write well-crafted code to solve a technical problem | Wrote easily readable, understandable, and editable code for making transactions with a bank account using a REPL. Coach reviewed, passed on first attempt and then refined | JavaScript, Node, Jest, Prettier |
| [**Bowling**](https://github.com/Zimmja/Makers-challenge-Thermostat) | Solo challenge: solve a technical problem and convert code from one language to another | Created a scoring card for a bowling game using Ruby (a deceptively difficult task requiring solid planning and execution), and then converted to JavaScript | JavaScript, Ruby, Node, Jest, Rspec |
| [**Thermostat**](https://github.com/Zimmja/Makers-challenge-Thermostat) | Pairing challenge: create and test-drive a simple JavaScript program using Node | We created a thermostat that could be interacted with via the command line and utilise API calls from OpenWeather to receive and display real-world info | JavaScript, Node, Jest, APIs |
| [**RPS Game**](https://github.com/Zimmja/Makers-challenge-RPS) | Solo challenge: create a game that is playable in a web browser | Tasked with creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) style game. Finished quickly and was able to stretch myself to a 16-item game (instead of the 3-item RPS game) | Ruby, Sinatra, Capybara, Selenium Webdriver, HTML, CSS, Rspec, Rubocop|

### Skills

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Zimmja&layout=compact)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

**Understanding client needs and rapidly responding** - one of my main responsibilities as an account handler was taking briefs from clients (written and spoken), understanding them well enough to identify questions and issues early on, quickly formulate solutions, discussing them with clients and actioning under tight timelines. For example, when a prospective client was disatisfied with her current agency, I was able to respond to her briefs, offer insights and produce an action plan so quickly and to such a high standard that she skipped the usual procurement process and hired our agency without asking us to pitch first.

**Understanding systems and developing processes** - identifying better processes for working with systems helped me add value to my employer's agency. When a new system for medical review ([Veeva Vault](https://www.veeva.com/products/enterprise-content-management/)) was launched across the healthcare advertising industry, I rapidly learned how it worked and developed our agency's processes for using it. These processes allowed us to approve advertising materials faster than other agencies, and a client asked me to present them over three workshops to other agencies so they could improve to our standard. This allowed our agency to present ourselves as experts in Veeva Vault, a barrier many prospective clients were keen to avoid.

**Problem solving** - proven track record of combining different skillsets to solve problems. For example, while in healthcare advertising, a colleague's client threatened to close an account with our agency due to our creative department's inability to present scientific information clearly and accurately. I volunteered to solve the issue myself, combining the client brief, my scientific knowledge, writing and design (usually handled by three different departments) to solve the issue. I found a solution, my colleague presented it, and the client remains with the agency to this day.
