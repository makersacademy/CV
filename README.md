Software Development is my passion and the perfect role give me a platform to innovate, continuous learn alongside smart, fun people who enjoy their job and teamwork.  As a former software tester I also bring an additional skill set to further assist in the the delivery of functioning software. It is a must to be within a company that backs their employees to deliver outstanding solutions.

### Skills for the job
#### Web Developer
A fast learner of new technologies who thoroughly enjoys being challenged.

* Ruby on Rails:
  - Fullstack Rails developer at Zopa. Day-to-day work covered morning standups, develop requirements, design, test and implement features, fix bugs, frontend design and implementation with HTML/CSS, refactoring and promotions to UAT.
  - Implemented background jobs using sidekiq to automate pdf letter generation and a queueing system. Resulted in a a significant performance gain and decoupled pdf generation out into its own area, adding new letters is significantly easier.
  - Moved the whole application (NginX, PSQL, Redis and the Rails app) into Docker containers which made deployments extremely easy. Created a makefile so the team could spin up dev, testing and staging environments with a single command.
* C#.net and Javascript experience on smaller projects.
* Testing and TDD:
  - My 9 years of Software Testing has equipt with  curiosity, attention to detail, in the construction of test scenarios from a technical and end user view points. Coding example with Rspec tests  [best-rate loan matcher](https://github.com/meads58/best_rate)
  - Strong TDD culture at Zopa and used Rspec and BDD with Capybara for testing.
* DevOps mindset:
  - Proactive to find ways to help other teams so we can continuously deploy. Added in logging to our Rails app for splunk logging, hipchat notification from jenkins on build statuses and a Docker, Vagrant, Puppet and Artifactory for our project's configuration management solution.
  - Working deployment solutions using Docker, Vagrant, Puppet, Octopus, Jenkins and Artifactory tools. This will allow for a quick spin up of identical environments on any machine and the removal of bottlenecks in the current deployment process.

#### Communication
Excellent, clear and concise communication skills.
* Pair programming:
  - Keen Zopa to quickly build up knowledge of the system code base and for reviewing code which successfully speeded up the release process.
* Business and Developer communication:
  - Excellent skills at bridging the communication gap between business and technical audiences built form the years spent as a tester liaising between developers and business users.
* Question asking:
  - Not afraid to ask for clarification early on and , which ensures focus is set to solve the correct problems.

#### Problem Solving
Breaking down problems into manageable chunks, attention to detail and designing solutions that integrate well.

* Define the problem:
  - Define the problem, break it down and look for any potential issues downstream. An exmaple at Zopa was the creation a process flow diagram for the new debt collection application. This served as the delivery road map clearly showing upstream and down stream dependencies for each step which was expanded out and coded for.
* Innovation:
  -  Looking to improve/refactor code for a genuine benefit. Example at Zopa with an opportunity to add needed flexibility of the 'on hold' feature. Instead of a solution to pause the Sidekiq queue, the queue time was made adjustable. This gave the users added flexibility for individual cases and also allowed them to simulate a full work flow in UAT.
* Planning and Design:
  - The [Battleship project](https://github.com/meads58/battleships/tree/master/lib)  project shows how the single responsibility principle was used to design the system. Achieved a clear understanding of building applications up from small manageable chunks to solve a specific problem led to making, maintaining and adding features easier.
