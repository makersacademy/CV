I am a junior software developer and graduate of 
[Makers Academy](#education).\
My background combines the hard-working logical thoroughness of working in 
[pharmaceutical research](#experience) 
with experience of customer service and working to client demands.

I'm looking for a back-end focussed role where I can continue to develop my technical ability and the problem-solving and teamworking skills that I used during the bootcamp.

I'm very excited about how the world of tech has created so many new ways to improve the lives of people all around the world. From large-scale ecological projects benefiting the natural world to the fact that banking is now a bit easier; real people are seeing real advantages based on the work of developers everywhere.

During the Makers bootcamp; the coursework focussed mainly on Ruby, JavaScript and SQL languages. I have continued to learn Python and PHP to continue my professional development.

### **Attention to detail**
In my previous role as a lab technician, one of my responsibilities was to proof-read technical documents relating to testing of samples. This took the form of homogenising the tone and language style of documents that may have been written over extended periods of time by several individuals; and conceptualising what was actually being asked for to make sure that there was some degree of flow and that instructions were in a sensible order. 
This has influenced my decision to change career, as this is a very useful skill to have as a software developer. Understanding how small steps flow together helps with building complex algorithms from small functions, and being able to spot small discrepancies in language use is great for debugging code.

- Developed a reputation for being the main reliable person to do this task.
- Made lab testing more efficient and straightforward for several projects; including on behalf of teams I was not a member of.

### **Fast learner**
Learning quickly is something that has helped me throughout my life. Working on multiple projects in various labs requires getting to grips with different lab equipment on a regular basis; and it is fairly typical for different clients and colleagues to have subtly different styles and requirements. 
Fast learning is best illustrated by how I was able to successfully navigate the coding bootcamp from a starting point of having no knowledge or understanding at all, and ending less than one year later in a position where I am managing my own projects and able to successfully try out new languages.
Also in my leisure time: board games and video games both must be understood pretty well if I'm to avoid coming in last place.

- While working at Cambridge consultants, I was the resident expert for using the 
[force testing equipment][mecmesin], 
a position I developed rapidly after it featured prominently in the first project I was involved in.
- I have demonstrated my ability to learn quickly throughout my academic career. Understanding the complicated concepts involved in chemistry when each module only lasts for two months; and getting to grips with the nuances of a programming language I've never heard of in preparation to attend the bootcamp.
- Some evidence of how my coding has progressed over time can be seen in my 
[codewars profile][codewars-killie-skank]
and the 
[GitHub&nbsp;repository][project-euler-gh]
containing the work I've done on Project Euler.

### **Teamworking**
I find working in well organised teams very fulfilling. It is a very satisfying feeling to have worked together to complete a task that would have been impossible for any of the individuals to have done alone. 
This is something that I experienced in the multi-disciplinary teams I was a member of while working at Cambridge Consultants, while I was studying and even as a member of sports teams. I used these experiences to my advantage by succesfully pair programming on projects throughout the bootcamp; a practise which was new to me at the time.

- Added my experience of working in a lab to project teams including physicists, software developers and mechanical engineers.
- Worked in a team that succesfully developed a novel [neuromodulation device][neuromodulation-wiki] from design concept to market release with very strict deadlines imposed by Health Canada
- Achieved distinction in group projects in subjects including chemistry and marketing.

## [^](#john-baxter)Hobbies
I like to contrast my busy tech work-life with stepping away from the screen and keyboard in my leisure time. A lot of what I do for fun could be described as traditional or old-fashioned. I also enjoy learning lots of information about a diverse range of subjects, so when something interests me I am likely to find something to read about it.
- Cooking is a nice activity to help wind down at the end of a busy day. I enjoy taking my time over the process, and experimenting with flavours. Eating delicious food at the end is also a bonus - and if something hasn't worked out, well that's what Tabasco is for. 
- Watching lower league (and non-league) football is a fun passtime for a Saturday afternoon. Going to a small stadium and getting involved with the local community is what I consider 'real' football. It's nice to be far removed from the TV cameras and million-pound advertising contracts.
- Learning languages is a good way to keep the brain active; so alongside Ruby, Python et al. I can also say: \
He estado aprendiendo español desde hace tres años.
- Practicing circus skills like juggling or whip-cracking is a physical passtime best enjoyed in a field with friends. I regularly attend an organised event in Warwickshire where I can learn how to balance objects on my chin, and even try things like archery. It's also a great way to meet loads of interesting people.
