Junior Web Developer & Makers Academy Graduate with a background in QA, Mathematics & Philosophy.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/harrim91/CV.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/harrim91/CV)

I *LOVE* solving problems, and I love making things. I have a demonstrable desire to learn, to push myself towards best practices, and to write the best, cleanest, most throughly tested code I possibly can.

I'm now looking for my first role as a developer in a company which has similar commitments to me. I care about craftsmanship, and I want to work with craftsmen who will challenge me and facilitate my learning.

Skills
---

#### Analytic
My undergrad and postgrad studies in Mathematics and Philosophy have shaped the way I think and given me a strong ability to break problems down and to understand and use complex ideas. 

#### Testing
I spent almost 2 years working as a QA Analyst, manually writing and executing feature and regression tests on a monolithic system. This has given me a real commitment to well tested, well written code.

#### I want do things the right way
I learned so much in my QA role and it inspired me to become a developer. I was offered a job as a junior visual basic developer at the company, but turned it down in order to attend Makers Academy and get a grounding in doing OOP, agile TDD properly.

## Product Reviews

`I've never met anybody like Michael. He is so unique. At first you just see like a pinprick, but when you get to know him he opens up and has so much more depth.`

`Michael is very, very, very intelligent and is a problem solver. He is always willing to take the time to explain things and is a good teacher.`

`He has crazy concentration. When working on a problem, he is so focussed and driven until he achieves his goal.`

`There is a romantic intensity to everything he does, from coding, to playing guitar, to talking about his girlfriend or wooden spoons.`
