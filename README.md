#Journey to  Becoming a Developer

During my previous job I was tasked with building an e-commerce website that
enabled customers to create accounts and facilitated the placement of orders.
I really enjoyed the challenge of building a website, however I encountered
difficulties implementing certain features, which were overcome by the use of
templates. As a result of not completing the site on my own I was determined
to teach myself web development. I spent most of 2014
learning from home through online courses such as Codecademy and Code School.
I then joined Makers Academy in February 2015 to progress and fully
embed my learning.
