## Meads Chalcroft

A bit of an extreme sport fanatic and now a family guy who is very excited and focused in becoming an outstanding software engineer.

Software tester in a past life with extensive experience working on agile projects to deliver working, functional software to the business. Became a junior web developer with experience building a range of web applications.

The perfect junior role would push for innovation, continuous learning and teamwork with fun, smart people that enjoy their job. All within a company that backs their employees to deliver outstanding solutions.

## Skills

#### Communication

Excellent clear and concise communication skills built up over my working career.

|Listening skills|Pair programming|Communication through code|
|-----------------------------------|
|Listen to clearly understand the problem and ask for clarification before working on the most fitting solution|Constaly used at Makers to knowledge share, test out ideas and smash through problems.|Well formatted code with clear and descriptive names and tests that are documentation.|
|Removed a defect bottleneck in the testing process at Trafigura through the efficient of the testing work flow from redesigning the bug tracking templates after listening to the problems developers were having reproducing defects.|Using a quick




- Pair programming at Makers Academy to solve problems. A successful example was pair coding the game [battleships](https://github.com/meads58/battleships), bouncing ideas off and sharing knowledge was a very quick way to solve problems.
- Gain buy in of an idea from the team through presenting a well planned solution. Whilst


#### Problem Solving

Breaking problems down into manageable chunks, attention to detail and planning skills to design out a solution and implement it.

- Final project at Makers [Proximibee](https://arcane-citadel-3693.herokuapp.com). Innovative thinking to take the Beacons technology and turn this into a working shopping solution.
- Planning and design. An example is [rock-paper scissors](https://github.com/meads58/rps-challenge/tree/master/lib) project using the single responsibility principle of a feature. Making it clear what each feature does  Use cases and the required objects were defined on paper first before fitting the features together.

#### Junior Web Developer

A fast learner who has been thrown into new technology weekly at Makers and thoughly enjoys , think about problem and make a suitable choice on what tools to use. Understanding that software development is an ongoing learning process but well grounded in solid principles of OOD, TDD and Software Design.

|Questioning skills|Testing and TDD
|---------------------------------|
|                 |Exceptional attention to detail from 9 years of Software Testing but now the TDD skill set to apply this to code.

 learned whilst a software tester and effectively transferred to web development. When faced with a problem steps taken are to define the problem, research and attempt a solution then seek help using the attempted solution as an example. This process greatly sped up getting the right answer.
- Testing and TDD. Already 9 years of software testing but now the TDD skills to apply this to code.
- OOD. All Makers Academy projects used TDD to lead the development of the code. This had the added benefit of documenting the functionality and was extremely valuable to seeing what the current features are.
