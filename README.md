## Robert Youngman

Agile is my passion and my trade.  Being an experienced Software Development
Manager, Certified Scrum Master and Product Owner I decided to learn
more about coding for the web with Makers Academy to make myself even more
valuable to software development teams.

I have experience of app development projects for iOS and android,
now I have full stack development skills.

I achieve fantastic results in small or large projects,  my last project involved
13 scrum teams geographically distributed across USA, Europe and India.

In the future I will ideally be leading software development teams using Agile.
