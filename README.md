I am a creative and curious person looking to utilise and develop my programming knowledge in a role as a **Full Stack Junior Developer specialising in front end**.

Having worked in retail since 16 and being a starving artist on the side, I was curious to seek out more challenges in life. During my time at Apple, I developed my passion for technology, apps and problem solving; I had fun creating an innovative design that brought more accurate communication between departments, which was incorporated into Apple's 'EasyPay' system and used in their retail stores nationwide. Over time, I developed a thirst for challenges and was subsequently offered a role from The JET Programme to work in Japan as an English teaching assistant. Whilst in Japan, I also had the opportunity to volunteer alongside my teaching role. I was passionate about helping to clean up the affected areas in exclusion zones, following the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku Earthquake which devastated the Fukushima prefecture. I also volunteered at events; promoting foreign cultural and conversation exchange, managing and organising kid's activities, and being a Sports Leader for the United Sports Foundation(USF) promoting health and well-being.

After 2 years in Japan, I returned home and took some time off before returning to Apple as a new starter, quickly being recognised for my hard-work, positive attitude and fast pace. I was often asked to support the BackStage team as I had quick turn-around-times and excelled when client-facing. After a few months, I was promoted to work as a Technical Specialist where I realised I had a knack for problem solving and wanted to do more with the software development side of things.

This led me to studying at Makers Academy, a 16-week intensive software development bootcamp where I am learning to code. I think that one of the reasons I love programming is that I love understanding how things work. I have always been interested in solving puzzles, whether it involved objects or mental I.Q.-type brainteasers; I love putting pieces together and using logic to solve them bit by bit.

I have a passion to learn and develop my programming skills to enable me to look for a role where I can extend my knowledge of programming.

## Skills

#### Problem-solver
I often used my down-times at Apple to have fun creating different things to improve and increase efficiency within the store. One thing I am particularly proud of is a design that brought more accurate communication between the sales and operations departments; there was an issue where the sales team had no idea what SIM card they were requesting from inventory as there were no images or network company information on their sales devices. Consequently, the wrong SIM cards were continuously being ordered and returned from the inventory team, wasting customers' valuable time and reducing a smooth interaction and experience for them overall. So, I decided to create a graphic template that displayed SIM card images alongside working barcodes and correct prices for the sales team to use; this generated the correct products to be ordered from our department by scanning the graphic via sales devices. After a week trial, my graphic template proved a success at reducing ordering times and increased customer satisfaction, so it was incorporated into Apple's 'EasyPay' system as part of their sales app and used in their retail stores nationwide.

#### Initiative
I found it exciting to go to Japan having little to no Japanese language skills and no contacts there. I looked at it as an opportunity to learn new skills, be adaptable to a new environment and network with locals. During my time there, I took it upon myself to self-study Japanese to a conversational level through hard work and perseverance. I made life-long friends with the locals and had the opportunity to take Japanese exams alongside my students; promoting solidarity, build relationships and have a positive attitude to work.
