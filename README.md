# Zeeshan Rasool

An economics graduate, small business owner, and junior financial analyst leaving behind a comfortable life to venture into the exciting unknown of the tech world.

After managing the family business and focusing on the financial investments of the business, I followed my passion of technology by joining Makers Academy and learning to code. 

I want to work with a vibrant, interesting group of people wanting to make software experience better for everyone while continuing to become a better version of myself along the way.

## Skills

### Programming

In the three months between September-December 2014 I went from not knowing a single line of code to becoming a junior developer bringing to the table a fresh mind for problem solving.

- Programming with Ruby and Javascript
- Ruby frameworks: Sinatra and Rails 4
- Using version control (Git)
- Deploying apps to the web (Heroku and AWS)
- Integrating external APIs into my projects (GitHub, Twilio, Stripe)
- Working with relational databases and ORMs (Postgresql & Datamapper)
- Working with agile principles and guidelines
- GitHub.com/zrasool88

### Problem Solving & People Management

From using Excel to make economic research bearable to managing a 50-people business, my problem solving skills developed from the academic and abstract world to the real world dealing with people

- Created a macros in Excel during my undergraduate dissertation to cut down my data gathering and data cleaning time frame from 4 weeks to 30 minutes.

- Advised on financial strategies to maximize return (tax optimization, diversifying portfolio from fixed deposits and bonds to also include stocks and property)

- Joining the family business as an heir, I moved to empower management by making them the face of changes the employees were asking for which included flexible working hours. This not only made the employees more satisfied and productive, but it made the management stronger, allowing me to leave the business up to them and pursue my passion in tech.
