## Meads Chalcroft

A relaxed easy person to get along with who is focused and driven to be an oustanding software engineer.

Succsuful former software tester who is very expereinced with working in a development team and liasing with business stakeholders directly to meet software requirements. Now a junior web developer with 3 months experience building web abblications.

The perfect role will allow me to immediatly contribute on projects whilst learning best practice of experienced developers. I want to work with people that enjoy their job and working with others, are proactive to improve and a company that backs their employees to deliver outstanding solutions.


## Skills

#### Communication

Excellent communication skills whilst working in development teams as a software tester. Capable of conveying accurate information to the development team, project managers and business analysts which resulted in them making the most informed decisions available.

- Listening skills allowing me to clearly understand the problem and ask suitable questions for clarification before working on the most fitting solution.
- Greatly improved the testing process at Trafigura by setting up a more efficient testing workflow and bug tracking templates because I listened to the problems developers were having reproducing defects.
- Pair programming at Makers required open communication to solve problems. A successful example was pair coding the game battleships where bouncing ideas off and sharing knowledge was a very quick way to solve problems.

#### Problem Solving

Breaking problems down into manageable chunks, attention to detail and planning skills to design out a solution and implement it.

- Our final project at Makers used iBeacons which determins a product list on your phone when in range. Working on the backend system to send an API from the database to the phone app the approach was to define, research, implement and fix, until a solution was found.

- Effective use of planning and design to solve a coding problem. One example project was to code a ten-pin bowling game. This was made significantly easier once use cases and required objects were defined on paper first before fitting the features together.

#### Junior Web Developer

Abilty to research and ask questions, think about the problem and make suitaible choice on what tools to use. Understands that there software development is an ongoing learning process but well grounded in solid prinicples of OOD, TDD and Software Design.

- Qustioning skills learnt whilst a softer tester and effectivly transfered to web development. When faced with a problem steps taken are to define the problem, research and attempt a solution and seek help using the attempted solution as an example. This process greatly sped up getting the right answer.
- Knowledge and exerience of TTD and OOD. All Makers Acadmey projects used TDD to lead the development of the code. This had the added benefit of documenting the functionality and was extremely valuable to seeing what the current features are.
