I am a music composer and producer that got seduced for the logical and abstract aspects
of coding, now facing a carrier change at Makers Academy. I've worked creating music for
feature film, tv series and advertisements, from now on glad to use my energy and creativity in designing elegant and efficient software. After a few weeks I'll be looking for my first
job as a junior developer in London.

#### Creativity

 requirements in order to contribute and make a project works.
 - Trained for taking in consideration different factors, such as dialogs, sound design, instrumentation, pitches, etc., in order to make my contribution useful and positive.
 - My clients and my work are the prove of my capacity to implement functional and solid work.

#### Focussed

and work capacity.

In the last years I have studied different matters on my own: music orchestration,
music counterpoint, piano playing, music software management and code. I am really
exited about the Makers Academy course, is a completely fascinating new world for me.
