## Alfie Freeman

I have studied Engineering at University and then Acoustics whilst working for an Acoustic Engineering company and have always had a keen interest in programming. I have also worked as a Site Engineer at major construction sites in London such as 20 Fenchurch Street and in the Canary Wharf Estate.

I have decided to hone my programming skills at Makers Academy so that I can remain useful in an ever changing world where it seems that software engineering is becoming the most interesting and fast moving field around.
