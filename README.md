## Meads Chalcroft

Software tester in a past life with extensive experience working on agile projects to deliver working, functional software to the business. Now a junior web developer with experience building a range of web applications.

The perfect junior role would push for innovation, continuous learning and teamwork alongside smart, fun people that enjoy their job. All within a company that backs their employees to deliver outstanding solutions.

## Skills for the job

#### Communication

Excellent, clear and concise communication skills have been built up over my working career.

* Understand what needs solving:
  - Ensure the problem is understood and asks for clarification before working on the most fitting solution.
  - Removed a bottleneck in the testing process at Trafigura, having redesigned the bug tracking templates, after listening to the problems developers had when reproducing defects.
* Pair programming:
  - Constantly used at Makers Academy to knowledge share, test out ideas and smash through problems.
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/meads58) showing the volume and range of work achieved in a short space of time with pair programming.
* Code that talks:
  - Well formatted code with clear and descriptive names and tests that act as documentation.
  - [rock-paper scissors](https://github.com/meads58/rps-challenge/blob/master/features/rock_paper_scissor.feature) is an example of tests acting as documentation.

#### Problem Solving

Breaking down problems into manageable chunks, attention to detail and planning skills proved key to designing out a solution and the implementation of it.

* Innovation:
  - Final project at Makers [Proximibee](https://github.com/meads58/proximibee_Admin/blob/master/README.rdoc) required innovative thinking to take the Beacon technology and turn this into the final working phone app solution.
* Planning and Design:
  - The [Battleship project](https://github.com/meads58/battleships/tree/master/lib)  project shows how the single responsibility principle was used to design the system. Achieved a clear understanding of building applications up from small manageable chunks to solve a specific problem led to making, maintaining and adding features easier.

#### Junior Web Developer

A fast learner who has been thrown into new technologies every week at Makers Academy and thoroughly enjoys being challenged.

* Questioning Skills:
  - Seeks further understanding after forming a possible solution as a starting point.
* Testing and TDD:
  - Exceptional attention to detail from 9 years of Software Testing in the construction of test scenarios.
  - Combined now with TDD skills to build solutions faster.
* Rapid Learning:
  - Ability to pick up a new technology and play with it to build up knowledge quickly.
  - Demonstrated in the huge range of tested and functional web applications built during the course.
