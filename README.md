## Meads Chalcroft

An extreme sport fanatic but now a family guy who is very excited and focused at becoming an outstanding software engineer.

Software tester in a past life with extensive experience working on agile projects to deliver working, functional software to the business. Became a junior web developer with experience building a range of web applications.

The perfect junior role would push for innovation, continuous learning and teamwork alongside fun, smart people that enjoy their job. All within a company that backs their employees to deliver outstanding solutions.

## Skills

#### Communication

Excellent clear and concise communication skills built up over my working career.

|Listening skills|Pair programming|Communication through code|
|----------------|----------------|----------------------------|
|Enure the problem is understood and asks for clarification before working on the most fitting solution| Constantly used at Makers to knowledge share, test out ideas and smash through problems.|Well formatted code with clear and descriptive names. Tests that act as documentation.|
|Removed a workflow bottleneck in the testing process at Trafigura after redesigning the bug tracking templates as a result of listening to the problems developers were having reproducing defects.|[GitHub](https://github.com/meads58) showing the volume of work achieved in a short space of time achieved by pairing.| [Battleship project](https://github.com/meads58/battleships/blob/master/spec/board_spec.rb) is an example of tests acting as documentation. |

#### Problem Solving

Breaking problems down into manageable chunks, attention to detail and planning skills to design out a solution and implement it.

- Final project at Makers [Proximibee](https://arcane-citadel-3693.herokuapp.com) required innovative thinking to take the Beacon technology and turn this into a working phone app solution.
- Planning and design. One example with the [rock-paper scissors](https://github.com/meads58/rps-challenge/tree/master/lib) project shows how the single responsibility principle was used to design the system features. Now to adding in 2 player mode or  .

#### Junior Web Developer

A fast learner who has been thrown into new technology weekly at Makers and throughly enjoys , think about problem and make a suitable choice on what tools to use. Understanding that software development is an ongoing learning process but well grounded in solid principles of OOD, TDD and Software Design.

|Questioning skills|Testing and TDD| Learning fast|
|------------------|---------------|---------|
|When faced with a problem steps taken are to define the problem, research and attempt a solution then seek help using the attempted solution as an example. This process greatly sped up getting the right answer.|Exceptional attention to detail from 9 years of Software Testing but now the TDD skill set to apply this to code.
