<h4 align=center>Full Stack Makers Academy Graduate</h4>



-----------------
## Skills

#### Project Management

- Managed teams of up to 15 people on major construction sites in London
- Worked together with Clients, Design Teams, on-site Tradesmen and other Contractors
- Managed smaller acoustic projects on my own from the design phase to completion during my time at Emtec.

#### Curious

- Have always been curious to know how things work and as a child I was always designing and building things at home. This curiosity has led me to study Mechanical Engineering and Acoustic Engineering at University level, and then Programming at Makers Academy.   

#### Motivated

- Back in 2014 I set up a viable business by finding profitable arbitrage opportunities whilst minimising any fees incurred through the banking system. This led to the self-taught development of a website built in php, html and JavaScript in a couple of months.

#### Creative

- In my previous role as an Acoustic Engineer, I would often have to come up with bespoke designs to reduce the noise levels of domestic and commercial equipment, often with strict requirements such as space restrictions.

#### Team Player

- I have captained both Football and Korfball teams during my time at School and University, with the notable improvement of the Korfball team over my years involved a particular proud achievement of mine.

#### Fast Learner

- Whilst building a Facebook Clone during Makers Academy, we tasked to rebuild the frontend in React - a new language to us at the time. I picked up the language very quickly and within a week could fluently build React components and manage data flow with Redux.
