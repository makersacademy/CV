## Meads Chalcroft

An extreme sport fanatic and a family guy who is very excited and focused at becoming an outstanding software engineer.

Software tester in a past life with extensive experience working on agile projects to deliver working, functional software to the business. Now a junior web developer with experience building a range of web applications.

The perfect junior role would push for innovation, continuous learning and teamwork alongside fun, smart people that enjoy their job. All within a company that backs their employees to deliver outstanding solutions.

## Skills

#### Communication

Excellent clear and concise communication skills built up over my working career.

* Listening skills
  - Ensures the problem is understood and asks for clarification before working on the most fitting solution.
  - Removed a bottleneck in the testing process at Trafigura after redesigning the bug tracking templates from listening to the problems developers were having reproducing defects.
* Pair programming
  - Constantly used at Makers to knowledge share, test out ideas and smash through problems.
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/meads58) showing the volume and range of work achieved in a short space of time achieved through pairing.
* Communication through code
  - Well formatted code with clear and descriptive names and tests that act as documentation.
  - [rock-paper scissors](https://github.com/meads58/rps-challenge/blob/master/features/rock_paper_scissor.feature) is an example of tests acting as documentation.

#### Problem Solving

Breaking problems down into manageable chunks, attention to detail and planning skills to design out a solution and implement it.

- Final project at Makers [Proximibee](https://arcane-citadel-3693.herokuapp.com) required innovative thinking to take the Beacon technology and turn this into a working phone app solution.
- Planning and design. An example is with the [Battleship project](https://github.com/meads58/battleships/tree/master/lib)  project showing how the single responsibility principle was used to design the system features. Result is clear understanding of building applications up from small manageable chunks to solve a specific problem making maintaining and adding features easier.

#### Junior Web Developer

A fast learner who has been thrown into new technologies every week at Makers and thoroughly enjoys being challenged. Understanding that software development is an ongoing learning process but well grounded in solid principles of OOD, TDD and Software Design.
