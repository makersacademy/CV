## Raefe Newton-Jones

I am a Software Engineer looking for a company with a mission I can really get behind, working collaboratively on improving peoples lives through innovation. The most enjoyable aspect of coding for me is writing a beautiful piece of code which is efficient, succinct and accessible. I love automating, in every arena possible.


*<div align="center">"[Raefe] quickly impressed the teams he worked in with his quick grasp of what we were working on and began to contribute at a usable level even earlier than I had hoped. Raefe is going to make great contributions wherever he goes".  - Steven Hamblin, CEO, Dyad </div>*

## Skills

#### Problem Solving


I've always prided myself on my ability to be pragmatic.
I have a particular strength in Maths and from a young age have enjoyed solving really difficult mathematical problems.
In the final project at Makers Academy I faced many high-level coding challenges. With no prior knowledge of Machine Learning I was able to test-drive three machine learning models.

One particular project I'm proud of in my professional career is building software that uses machine learning to help influence clinician decisions. The project involved creating a data pipeline; integrating existing APIs with the machine learning engineers' algorithm, it is currently being used in NHS hospitals.

#### Strong Communication Skills

In year 12 at school I was part of the Young Enterprise Program. I was voted by my peers and year 13 to represent the company as Managing Director which involved public speaking, and management of the team.  
At University I was made vice captain of the City Water Polo Team in Dundee within the first few weeks playing for the club.

#### Unstoppable

You won't often find people raving about the fact they dropped out of university posted all over their CVs. Leaving University was a difficult decision for me, it left me in London with no qualifications, job or financial support. Being completely independent since the age of 19, I've had to work hard to get to where I am today and have absolutely no desire to stop now. When I set myself a task there is little or nothing that will stand in my way.

We wrote models to detect cancerous tumours and diabetes. We went into the week with no experience in machine learning and we were able to test drive all the models with 100% coverage  | Python, Unittest, Tensorflow |
|2. [Acebook](https://github.com/Raefey/acebook-dart)  | A two week group project to create a clone of Facebook  | Ruby on Rails, RSpec, JQuery, Postgres, Heroku  |
|3. [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/Raefey/bank-tech-test)  | A practice tech test, simulating a Bank, focusing on the bank statement  | Ruby, RSpec |
|4. [Bowling Challenge](https://github.com/Raefey/bowling-challenge)  | A bowling-score calculator, I was proud of this project as I used a really interesting recurring method  | Javascript, Jasmine |
|5. [Thermostat](https://github.com/Raefey/thermostat-challenge)  | A simulation of a Thermostat, with an interactive web page, built in my first week of Javascript  | Javascript, Jasmine, JQuery  |
|6. [Oystercard Challenge](https://github.com/Raefey/oystercard)  | The content of my second week of the Makers Academy course, a simulation of the Oystercard system  | Ruby, RSpec  |
