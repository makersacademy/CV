## Robert Youngman

Agile Scrum enthusiast with more the 7 years experience using agile to deliver
complex software development projects. Experienced Certified Scrum Master, Agile Product
Owner and Software Development Manager.

After recenty being made redundant when my employer moved product development offshore
and closed the Bristol development center, I decided I needed a technology refresh to
learn the most used web development technologies. I have previously managed app development
projects for iOS and android but I wanted  to learn full stack development as well as
TTD techniques and tools.

I have managed scrum development teams geographically distributed across the USA, Europe and
India. My last project involved 13 scrum teams working on a single software release.

In the future I will ideally be leading software development teams using Agile Scrum. I'm skilled at planning and getting the most from software development teams using Agile methodology.

## Skills

I am a Certified Scrum Master, Agile Product Owner, Project Manager and software developer.
