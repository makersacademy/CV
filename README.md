## Skills

#### Communication

Excellent communication skills built up over my working career from collaborating on development teams with a clear and concise manner.

- Listening skills to clearly understand the problem and ask for clarification before working on the most fitting solution.
- Improved the testing process at Trafigura by increasing the efficient of the testing work flow from redesigning the bug tracking templates after listening to the problems developers were having reproducing defects.
- Pair programming at Makers Academy to solve problems. A successful example was pair coding the game [battleships](https://github.com/meads58/battleships), bouncing ideas off and sharing knowledge was a very quick way to solve problems.
- Gain buy in of an idea from the team through presenting a well planned solution. Whilst


#### Problem Solving

Breaking problems down into manageable chunks, attention to detail and planning skills to design out a solution and implement it.

- Our final project at Makers [Proximibee](https://arcane-citadel-3693.herokuapp.com) with iBeacons was complex and was managed through small defining the root problem and working for example the first step was to simple allow the phone app to change colour when in range of a Beacon before adding the next feature.
- Effective use of planning and design to solve a coding problem. One example with the [ten-pin bowling game](https://github.com/meads58/bowling-challenge) project. Use cases and the required objects were defined on paper first before fitting the features together.

#### Junior Web Developer

Eager to learn and ask questions, think about problem and make a suitable choice on what tools to use. Understanding that software development is an ongoing learning process but well grounded in solid principles of OOD, TDD and Software Design.

- Questioning skills learned whilst a software tester and effectively transfered to web development. When faced with a problem steps taken are to define the problem, research and attempt a solution then seek help using the attempted solution as an example. This process greatly sped up getting the right answer.
- Knowledge and experience of TDD and OOD. All Makers Academy projects used TDD to lead the development of the code. This had the added benefit of documenting the functionality and was extremely valuable to seeing what the current features are.
