I am a creative and curious person looking to utilise and develop my programming knowledge in a role as a **Full Stack Junior Developer specialising in front end**.

At Apple, I developed my passion for technology, apps and problem solving; I created an innovative design that brought more accurate communication between departments, which was incorporated into Apple's 'EasyPay' system in their stores nationwide. I was also recognised for my hard-work, positive attitude and fast pace; I had quick turn-around-times and excelled when client-facing. I realised I had a knack for problem solving and wanted to do more with the software development side of things.

This led me to studying at Makers Academy, a 16-week intensive software development bootcamp where I am learning to code. I think that one of the reasons I love programming is that I love understanding how things work. I have always been interested in solving puzzles, whether it involved objects or mental I.Q.-type brainteasers; I love putting pieces together and using logic to solve them bit by bit.

## Skills

#### Problem-solver
At Apple I used my initiative and creativity to improve and increase efficiency within the store. One thing I am particularly proud of is a design that brought more accurate communication between the sales and operations departments, which was incorporated into Apple's 'EasyPay' system in their stores nationwide; there was an issue with incorrect inventory being requested from the sales team, so I created a graphic template that could be scanned, which generated the correct products from inventory via sales devices which was incorporated into an app after a week trial.

#### Initiative
I found it exciting to go to Japan having no Japanese language skills or contacts there. I looked at it as an opportunity to learn new skills, be adaptable to a new environment and network with locals. I self-studied Japanese to a conversational level through hard work and perseverance and made life-long friends with the locals. I also took Japanese language exams alongside the students I taught English to; promoting solidarity, building relationships and having a positive attitude to work.

#### Fast learner
During my time at Makers Academy, I have had the opportunity to gain new skills in a short amount of time. I have been able to go from knowing nothing about programming to learning 2 new languages and several technologies to make working apps every week. I find resources and constantly ask for feedback to make me a better programmer and collaborator.

#### Collaborator
I have worked with various walks of life in all my past jobs as well as at Makers Academy. I am always one who listens to my team's suggestions, ideas and critique as well as being creative and a good contributor to the group. We made a MakersBnB project as a team, and that only worked well because we all collaborated; we set our stand-ups in the mornings detailing any issues we had, we rotated on pairings so that we got to work with every person and could work on every part of the project, had a kan-ban board of our project and had retros every evening.

I worked in a fast paced environment where I always brought energy and enthusiasm to the role to solve problems and repair customer relationships with the brand.

That could include a device with a cracked screen to software problems to locked accounts.

*Product Zone Specialist & BackStage Support*  
I advised, set-up and helped to create new owners of Apple products. I found the right solutions for customers and listened to their needs which in turn, created and  maintained relationships with the brand. I managed incoming foot-traffic and directed customers to the required areas/products. I also supported the BackStage team due to my previous experience and knowledge in a flagship store.  

**The Japanese Exchange and Teaching (JET) Programme** (July 2013 - August 2015)   

*English Teaching Assistant*  
I worked directly for Nihonmatsu City’s Board of Education and assisted with international awareness, education and foreign language instruction at two Junior High Schools in partnership with the British and Japanese Embassies and Governments. My responsibilities included preparing teaching materials for classes, training and preparing students for English Speech Contests, delivering in-service training for foreign language teachers and preparing special, extra-curricular and local international  exchange activities.  

**Apple** (September 2011 - July 2013)  

*Back of House Specialist*  
I had a hands-on role in the Back of House department as part of the Operations team, working with a tight-knit team on inventory, processes, reports & investigations.  


## Interests
- Running - I try to run 3-5miles a few times a week
- Hiking - a trail with waterfalls is a plus; the more difficult the trail, the better - despite having difficulty breathing in high altitudes (no pain no gain!)
- Photography & Editing - I'm arty!
- Cooking - give me ingredients and I'll make it work! A disaster at baking though - fair warning!
