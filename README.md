Notes


During a year out of University in 2014, a friend and I set up a Bitcoin Brokering business. We managed to set up a viable business by finding profitable artbitrage opportunities whilst minimizing any fees incurred through the banking system. This included developing a professional relationship with a major UK Bitcoin Exchange, and we were invited to their inaugral *Professional Bitcoin Brokers* meet. After a few months of trading, we decided to create a website using PHP, MySQL, html and javascript to minimise fees even further. We had never been taught any programming languages and embarked on the project utilising primarily youtube and stackoverflow. Despite finishing the project and deploying it on Amazon Web Services, we never went live as we weren't confident about handling financial transactions with our self learnt knowledge.
