|[__MakersRich__](https://github.com/toddpla/makersrich) [<img src='./assets/Github-Mark.png'/>](https://github.com/toddpla/makersrich) |Worked alongside four fellow peers to build an educational online multiplayer role playing game. We used React and Redux for the frontend and Firebase to provide the database and online functionality. |__JS, React, Redux, Firebase__|__Cypress, Jest__|
|[__Acebook__](https://github.com/toddpla/acebook-stars) [<img src='./assets/Github-Mark.png'/>](https://github.com/toddpla/acebook-stars)| Used Rails to build a Facebook clone in a week, with posts, comments and likes functionality. Rebuilt the frontend in React in the second week, and refactored the Rails product into an API to serve the frontend. |__Rails, JS, React__|__RSpec, Jest__|
|[__Test-Sweet__](https://github.com/rbbri/sweet) [<img src='./assets/Github-Mark.png'/>](https://github.com/rbbri/sweet)| Collaborated with a colleague to build a JavaScript testing framework and published it as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/test-sweet). |__JS__|__Test-Sweet__|

## Skills

#### Teamwork

- I have captained both Football and Korfball teams during my time at School and University, with the notable improvement of the Korfball team over my years involved a particular proud achievement of mine.

#### Project Management

- Managed teams of up to 15 people on major construction sites in London
- Worked together with Clients, Design Teams, on-site Tradesmen and other Contractors
- Managed smaller acoustic projects on my own from the design phase to completion during my time at Emtec.

#### Motivated

- Back in 2014 I set up a viable business by finding profitable arbitrage opportunities whilst minimising any fees incurred through the banking system. This led to the self-taught development of a website to sell Bitcoin built in php, html and JavaScript in a couple of months.

#### Creative

- In my previous role as an Acoustic Engineer, I would often have to come up with bespoke designs to reduce the noise levels of domestic and commercial equipment, often with strict requirements such as space restrictions.

#### Fast Learner

- Whilst building a Facebook Clone during Makers Academy, we tasked to rebuild the frontend in React - a new language to us at the time. I picked up the language very quickly and within a week could fluently build React components and manage data flow with Redux.

####Â Curious

- Have always been curious to know how things work and as a child I was always designing and building things at home. This curiosity has led me to study Mechanical Engineering and Acoustic Engineering at University level, and then Programming at Makers Academy.
