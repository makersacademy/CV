## Robert Youngman

Agile Scrum enthusiast with more than 7 years experience using agile to deliver
complex software development projects. Experienced Certified Scrum Master, Agile Product
Owner and Software Development Manager.

After recenty being made redundant when my employer moved product development
offshore and closed the Bristol development center, I decided I needed a
technology refresh to learn the most used web development technologies. I have
previously managed app development projects for iOS and android but I wanted
to learn full stack development, TDD techniques and tools.

I have managed scrum development teams geographically distributed across the
USA, Europe and India. My last project involved 13 scrum teams working on a
single software release.

In the future I will ideally be leading software development teams using Agile
Scrum. I'm skilled at planning and getting the most from software development
teams by using Agile methodology.

## Skills

I am a Certified Scrum Master, Agile Product Owner, Project Manager and
software developer.
