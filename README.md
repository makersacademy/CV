## Oliver Baum

I'm a former theatre technician, wanting to turn my love for productivity and automation scripting into a career. I aim to build apps and websites implementing features that make people's lives better, happier and more productive.

### Skills

##### Building/Fixing stuff

I'm from a family of hobbyist crafters, DIYers and  builders. In that environment, it's hard not to inherit the make-do and mend attitude to life. Working in technical theatre, I regularly have to learn a new skill in order to build or fix something or assist with the running of a production, whether it's learning how to roll cigarettes for an onstage smoking scene, upholstering furniture or using a new sound desk. I think this constant cycle of learning skills is key to my new life as a developer where I will constantly be forced to learn new languages and tools in order to build projects.

##### Scripting

I was first attracted to programming when trying to make using my mac faster and easier. I discovered productivity tools like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) and [Popclip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/), and taught myself to use applescript, shell scripts and python to write small extensions for them, like an extension that quits all open apps but one, an extension to keep a macbook awake with the lid closed for a given duration, and an extension that allows you to control mac's picture-in-picture mode with keyboard shortcuts. These serve to demonstrate my attitude to coding and making things: if it doesn't work how you like, or you want to make it better, then dive in and build something functional that changes that.

##### Self-teaching

I love to learn. At A level I took an extra subject by choice, and later self taught myself Latin and Further Maths and took an English Literature course. Learning to organise my own education made me learn a lot about how I learn, but mostly I learnt that teaching yourself *entirely* on your own is really difficult! Now that I'm at Maker's academy, I hope to make the most of working with and around other people to challenge my thinking and accelerate my learning.

### Education

##### Makers' Academy, London (August 2018 to November 2018)
*A prestigious intensive 16 week bootcamp designed to produce students confident in **OOP, TDD, MVC + DDD** programming, and **Agile** work practices.*

- Languages/tools learnt: **Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, RSpec, Jasmine**

- Maker's academy drives me to learn the key concepts of programming at an intense pace, while still giving me the freedom to spend time consolidating topics or reading ahead to the next material.

- The pair programming teaching model at Makers is making me a stronger programmer. I'm forced to work constantly with different people and adapt my workflow to suit their way of working and produce the best possible code.

- I want to use blogging, social media and public speaking as an opportunity to fuel my interests and improve my confidence as a member of the dev community.
