# Jade King

Passionate techy interested in all things digital, especially if it's open source and cross platform.
Have contributed to several commercial projects as a Full stack developer as well as working on side projects.


Educated in programming and software development principles at university, then completed a full-time developer boot-camp where I learnt how to develop software collaboratively, in an agile work environment.

I want to create great user experiences where technology and design is a help not a hindrance.

## Skills

#### Full Stack Development

Have built frontend and backend components commercially, through weekly projects at [Makers Academy][3] and university projects. This includes several Rails projects and python projects using Flask.
At MA I contributed to the [frontend][5] creating structure and styling using Bootstrap, [Sass][1] and HAML and the [backend][6] creating features such as logins, user profiles and image upload using paperclip and AWS. Commercially I have worked on Rails applications, Python dashboards and several websites.


#### Test Driven Development
MA focused strongly on TDD and we approached all our projects with TDD, creating [feature][7] and [unit][8] tests. I am a strong advocate for TDD and have continued to use this approach in my work. I also have experience working on untested code and writing tests for previously untested code.

#### Pair Programming
Mastered pair programming via Google Hangouts. Having completed MA remotely I learnt to successfully pair program while also combating the challenges of working remotely. I believe pair programming is a very productive way of working and I have commercial experience of solo and pair programming, both of which I believe have there place.

#### Agile / Scrum
Have worked in an agile environment at a startup company and while training at MA. Being the first Ronin group there was lot of challenges to overcome and every week we where adjusting how we worked together and how we approached the work. We had daily morning and afternoon stand-ups throughout the course and I am comfortable in leading them.

#### Linux
Have been working on Fedora OS for the last two years and am comfortable doing my tasks such as testing, file navigation and Git commands from the terminal.
I also have experience in using Debian OS's such as Mint.
