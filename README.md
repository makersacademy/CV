## Samuel Worrall

An up and coming software developer with an insatiable need to learn and master new skills. I have recently finished my time at Bristol University where my studies in archaeology and history left my mind craving more technical challenges.

I am searching for a role that constantly poses new challenges which can be solved using my creative and analytical skillset. The overall aim is to work on and contribute to big, important, innovative projects that take me to all manner of places.

## Skills

#### Analysis and research

I cultivated my analytical and research skills whilst at university. Essays that required hard source-based evidence along with a critical mindset made up a large part of the curriculum. The very nature of the degree gave me the opportunity to analyse and scrutinise not only the work of a range of scholars, but also my own.

#### Customer service

Through my time volunteering for Hospices of Hope and working as a sales assistant for the British Heart Foundation, I was able to gain a professional understanding of customer interaction. I would attend to questions and requests on a day-to-day basis, and would strive to give all customers the most positive and friendly experience possible.

#### Team working

I had the opportunity to work with many fellow students on collaborative projects during my degree. Furthermore, I was able to work with a team of both paid staff and a host of volunteers of all ages and abilities whist working at the British Heart Foundation. Through these experiences I learned how to work with others respectfully, but also how to spur and encourage them to increase productivity.

#### Independent learning

During my second and third years at university I taught myself HTML, CSS, and basic Ruby and JavaScript as a hobby.
