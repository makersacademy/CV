<h4 align=center>Full Stack Makers Academy Graduate</h4>

Full stack recent Makers Academy graduate with a strong aptitude for picking up new technologies. My background in engineering has equipped me with a high level of technical knowledge, a natural problem solving skill-set and an eagerness to learn. I am particularly passionate about cryptocurrencies and other exciting emerging technology and am looking to start a career in the booming London tech scene with immediate opportunities to expand my knowledge as a Developer.

## Skills

<!-- dont need bullet points if just one point  - make more than one point maybe?-->

**Fast Learner** <br>
Whilst building a Facebook Clone during Makers Academy, we tasked to rebuild the frontend in React - a new language to us at the time. I picked up the language very quickly and within a week could fluently build React components and manage data flow with Redux.

**Teamwork**
- Used Agile (scrum) processes to help complete a particularly ambitious group project at Makers Academy. Working together we achieved far more than we could have working individually and enjoyed the two weeks immensely.
- I have captained both Football and Korfball teams during my time at School and University, with the notable improvement of the Korfball team over my years involved a particularly proud achievement of mine.

**Motivated**
- Back in 2014 I set up a viable business by finding profitable arbitrage opportunities whilst minimising any fees incurred through the banking system. The company was profiting Â£3k/month.
- This passion led to the self-taught development of a website to broker Bitcoin built in php, html and JavaScript in a couple of months.

**Project Management**
- Managed teams of up to 15 people on major construction sites in London
- Worked together with clients, design teams, on-site tradesmen and other contractors
- Managed acoustic projects on my own from the design phase to completion during my time at Emtec.


**Creative** <br>
In my previous role as an Acoustic Engineer, I would often have to come up with bespoke designs to reduce the noise levels of domestic and commercial equipment, often with strict requirements such as space restrictions.

**Curious** <br>
Have always been curious to know how things work and as a child I was always designing and building things at home. This curiosity has led me to study Mechanical Engineering and Acoustic Engineering at University level, and then Programming at Makers Academy.
