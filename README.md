## Sam Broughton

I'm an amateur philosopher, tv fanatic, Cambridge dropout and newly-minted coder whose awkward stumble through life has yielded many interests from experimental psychology to classical ballet. Now that Makers Academy has given me access to a limitless new world of digital creation, I'm eager to channel these interests into as many projects as I have time for with as many people as possible.
