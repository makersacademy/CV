## Skills for the job

#### Web Developer

A fast learner of new technologies and thoroughly enjoys being challenged.

* Ruby on Rails:
  - Fullstack developer at Zopa implementing a Rails web app in Ruby, Postgres, CSS/HTML, Docker, Git and Redis/Sidekiq.
* Testing and TDD:
  - Exceptional attention to detail from 9 years of Software Testing in the construction of test scenarios.
  - Strong TDD culture at Zopa and we I used Rspec and BDD with Capybara for testing. Set up tests to run in Jenkins as regression tests for Continuous Integration of all pushed code.
* Rapid Learning:
  - Ability to pick up a new technology and play with it to build up knowledge quickly.
* Javascript
  - Written fully tested projects in javascript.

#### Communication

Excellent, clear and concise communication skills that have been built up over my working career.


* Pair programming:
  - Used at Zopa to quickly build up knowledge of the system code base and for reviewing code as we go which successfully sped up the release process.
* Code that talks:
  - Well formatted code with clear and descriptive names and tests that act as documentation.
  - [best-rate loan matcher](https://github.com/meads58/best_rate) is an example of tests acting as documentation.

#### Problem Solving

Skills to break down problems into manageable chunks, attention to detail and designing solutions that integrate well.

* Define the problem:
  - At Zopa created a process flow diagram after talking to the business owner and shared this with the team for feedback. This was then used as the wireframe for the actual system.
* Innovation:
  -  At Zopa saw an opportunity to add needed flexibility with the system and wrote a feature to enable the Sidekiq queue length to be adjusted. This gave the users added flexibility with their worked cases and allowed them to simulate a full work flow in UAT.
* Planning and Design:
  - The [Battleship project](https://github.com/meads58/battleships/tree/master/lib)  project shows how the single responsibility principle was used to design the system. Achieved a clear understanding of building applications up from small manageable chunks to solve a specific problem led to making, maintaining and adding features easier.
