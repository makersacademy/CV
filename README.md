## Personal Profile
I am a graduate of the Makers Academy bootcamp. I am very keen to progress in this new career in coding after discovering how involving it is to investigate & contribute to code solutions both independently & within a team through peer-programming.

After enjoying the progress I first made on Code Academy and Code Wars, this initial interest led me to joining the Makers course & currently I am in the consolidation stage. I feel I am starting to reach a much more solid grounding in understanding the fundamentals of all aspects of the tech stack and am better equipped by the course to discuss & disseminate a wealth of information to find specific methods that can contribute helpfully to projects.

I would describe myself as an enthusiastic and committed person who is very keen to learn and develop new skills in the coding field and learn continually from helpful 'errors' & know the joy of breaking through blockers and turning those testing colours from red to green. I am a gentle and easy-to-get-along-with person with good, literate communication skills & hope to develop those necessary skills within group projects to build well-designed & useful applications.

## Coding Experience

- **Completed Makers Academy course in June 2022**\
Currently in the consolidation phase & enjoying developing my understanding of all aspects of the tech stack & MVC.

- **Previously completed Code Academy courses in Ruby and Javascript & started follow-up courses.**

- **Working through The Odin Project as part of the consolidation phase.**

- **Have achieved 169 mastery points on Codewars – 6 kyu in Ruby/7 kyu Javascript.**

The Makers course helped me to learn with a lot of self-motivated research how to construct apps that fulfilled a criteria from the ground up from user stories via domain modelling. I learnt how to research from a wealth of information to differentiate & decipher the necessary methods to help with a project & how to communicate clearly within a team to assist in developing working code built from rigorous testing. While learning to make my own code more precise, following SRP in OOP & learning rigorous principles of TDD, Makers has laid me a very rigorous groundwork to all the fundamentals of full-stack development. I'm very keen to build on this process of developing secure, well-written code using incremental testing.

## Skills

In many of my roles I've had to combine use of technology with a variety of challenging situations. This is while directing someone else to also use technology to facilitate their development and achieve success in helping grow their knowledge & skills. I've had to be very organised in a lot of my roles, coordinating with a large group of staff, using computers in an organisational role. This ability to organise and delegate has also been within both team and solo situations where I've had to be resourceful and I feel I can achieve success with both.

I had years of experience in previous education support & therapy roles where I've had to keep stress under control in some difficult circumstances with students & children with additional support needs but have helped people achieve their goals with supporting their learning, sometimes using technology, while remaining calm and focused on a task & in coordination with other team members. I found this has given me a grounding in working in challenging coding situations within the course where a group of us who hadn't worked together before had to delegate working through a challenging project, using working styles & tech we hadn't used before and to achieve success quickly, while all being part of the creation of a working and visually satisfying, interactive end product that hopefully fulfilled the brief.

Within the Makers course I've been able to show I can bring the skills of patience and good communication to a situation and be able to work on sourcing information about a method that could help further that project and make very valuable contributions to successful projects. I can also take delegation from other team members with a willingness to work on something that will contribute usefully to the team project as a whole. The resilience, calmness & flexibility learned from my previous work experience definitely saw me help in something like our final project. I hopefully showed I could be supportive and use agile principles to be able to move flexibly between roles and technology and to adapt to new technology such as using REACT for the first time, but also to discuss and write an inclusive team methodology that made everyone feel supported and part of the success of a project from the outset.
