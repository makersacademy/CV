## Samuel Worrall

An up and coming software developer with an insatiable need to learn and master new skills. I have recently finished my time at Bristol University where my studies in archaeology and history left my mind craving more technical challenges.

I am searching for a role that constantly poses new challenges which can be solved using my creative and analytical skillset. The overall aim is to work on and contribute to big, important, innovative projects that take me to all manner of places.

#### Clean code and TDD advocate

I am an advocate for clean, DRY, readable, and adaptable code. I have learned that in the long run, this approach lowers the risk of mistakes having wide spread effect, and allows new features to be added with ease without breaking current tests.

I believe that a TDD approach is integral to good software development. At makers, I have found that compliance to the ways of TDD have massively improved my ability to write efficient code, debug and gain visibility when faced with blockers.

#### Analysis and research

I cultivated my analytical and research skills whilst at university. Essays that required hard source-based evidence along with a critical mindset made up a large part of the curriculum. The very nature of the degree gave me the opportunity to analyse and scrutinise not only the work of a range of scholars, but also my own.

These skills have allowed me to learn independently, and hold my code to a high standard whilst at Makers Academy. Structured and intuitive research plays a key role when faced with problems, especially useful when I had to learn Rails and Node in a matter of days; and self criticism and analysis help maintain DRY and readable code.

#### Customer service

Through my time volunteering for Hospices of Hope and working as a sales assistant for the British Heart Foundation, I was able to gain a professional understanding of customer interaction. I would attend to questions and requests on a day-to-day basis, and would strive to give all customers the most positive and friendly experience possible.

#### Team working

I had the opportunity to work with many fellow students on collaborative projects during my degree. Furthermore, I was able to work with a team of both paid staff and a host of volunteers of all ages and abilities whist working at the British Heart Foundation. Through these experiences I learned how to work with others respectfully, but also how to spur and encourage them to increase productivity.

Whilst at Makers, I was able to hone these skills on multiple occasions, not only through pair programming, but whilst working as part of teams of up to 5 developers. I learned the value of keeping every team member up to speed with individual developments, so as to avoid knowledge gaps.

#### Independent learning

During my second and third years at university I taught myself HTML, CSS, and basic Ruby and JavaScript as a hobby.

#### Makers Academy (March 2018 to July 2018)

- Fast, independent learner - Learned the basics of Node.js and Express.js in under a week for a group project, I had to teach myself brand new tech in a very short amount of time. Created a Facebook clone from scratch using Ruby-on-Rails and various gems that all had to be learned in the space of 2 weeks.

- Great collaborator - Worked in a team of 5 during weeks 8 and 9 of Makers. We combined morning standups, afternoon retrospectives, and the use of organisational helpers such as Trello to meet all the requirements for an engineering project (See Acebook in Projects).
