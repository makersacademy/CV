## Simon Ashbery

Before starting Makers Academy I was an artist, and looking at the course and it's syllabus I imagined a clear divide between my life before learning to code and after. Having begun my quest to become a programmer however, I've found the two professions have more in common than not, that I'm still using the same hard won skills, experience and knowledge to build, explore and learn.

I have a palpable need to create and to think my way around problems. I'm at my best when I explore, collaborate and wield new ideas with wild and reckless abandon and I've done so for the last 7 years. I've worked as an artist in the games industry, as an entrepreneur aspiring to launch my own indie game and now as a software engineer, diving head first into a vast, exciting field which represents more opportunities to learn than I ever thought possible.

## Skills

#### Creative Thinking.

Something is missing unless I'm mulling over a problem or constructing a new idea. It's something I was built to do and it's why I'm so well suited to any field that requires lateral thought and creative exploration.

When I lead the team behind Rosvita out to the Swedish countryside for the Stugan accelerator we hit a rough patch with the game. By the half way mark of the 3 month programme, no matter how we tried to tweak and tease it, our quirky puzzle game just wasn't working.

I mulled over this problem for a long time and was faced with two choices. Either we kept what we had so far and use the remaining time to produce a well polished but ultimately flawed demo, or we do something drastic.

I chose drastic, and completely redesigned the game from the ground up, keeping the core concept of the game but totally changing it's design and implementation. The result was a mad month and a half of late nights and frantic development, but In the end we had a demo that was fun, striking and beautiful.

You can see the final trailer for our demo here: https://vimeo.com/161765157 and the development process was documented on my blog: https://artunitfive.tumblr.com/

#### Communication

Whether it's treading the boards, pitching to publishers or just mulling over a problem with a partner or team; clear, concise communication is something I excel at.

On two occasions I have been asked by my Alma-mater to give a lecture. The first was to school age students outlining how they can further their education in art an animation. The second was to current students at the university and detailed the process of transitioning to professional life, outlining my own experiences, problems and triumphs along the way.
After the lecture was given I was asked by several students to give them one on one feedback and advice and was later told the feedback from students was very positive.

#### Self motivated learning.

I'm not a great believer in talent, I'd rather put my trust in hard won skills and knowledge. Throughout my life and career I've taken any opportunity I can to learn something new or improve an older skill.

AT 13 I found out I could make my own levels for my favourite games. Fascinated by this I spent every spare moment of the next few years teaching myself all I could about 3d modelling and computer graphics. 

Previously I had thought artistic ability was something you either had to didn't but at 18, I taught myself to draw. It was hard going but eventually I won a much saught after place on a traditionally focused and drawing heavy animation course at the Arts University Bournemouth. 

Since graduating the learning has not stopped. I studied acting, gaining a foundation diploma in the process. I constantly teach myself new skills and technologies in my professional field (examples of which can be viewed on my portfolio: http://artunitfive.squarespace.com/). I read up on game design and writing, attending various talks, lectures and conferences to bolster my knowledge in order to make my first attempt at leading a team becoming an independent developer. And now, at Makers Academy, I am once again throwing myself in at the deep end and learning a new suite of skills and concepts.
