## Your Name
<!--
A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment. -->

I am a music composer and producer that got seduced for the logical and abstract aspects
of coding, facing a carrier change at Makers Academy. I've worked creating music for
feature film, tv series and advertisements, now ready to use my creativity in designing
sophisticated, elegant and efficient software. After a few weeks I'll be looking for my first
job as a junior developer in London.
