## Sam Broughton

I'm an amateur philosopher, TV fanatic and enthusiastic coder whose awkward stumble through life has accumulated many interests from experimental psychology to classical ballet. Now that Makers Academy's 12-week Remote bootcamp has given me access to a limitless world of digital creation, I'm eager to channel these interests into as many projects as I have time for with as many people as possible.

## Skills

#### Systematic thinker, problem solver
- My training in philosophy and formal logic at the University of Cambridge has helped immensely in my approach to coding, and allowed me to hone my ability to break down a problem systematically into distinct components.

#### Fast learner
- For our Makers Academy final project: [Make It Stop! Alarm Clock](https://github.com/MakeItStop/task-based-alarm), my team and I wanted to challenge ourselves to learn a brand-new javascript framework, so we chose a combination of two we had never heard of - Nativescript with Angular 2. By the end of the 12-day project we had produced a fully operational app, soon to be deployed on the app store!

#### Attentive to detail
- My previous job in an investment bank involved facilitating payments often worth upwards of a billion pounds' value in various currencies. Since one incorrect digit could result in huge financial losses and some very unhappy clients, I was inspired to develop an obsessive attention to detail.
