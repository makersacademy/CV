## Muzzi Amir Aldean

Formerly a Jack of all trades, I have decided to become a master of *some*. After completing a degree in International Business and Communications, I obtained experience in a variety of roles in a variety of countries. My experience spans journalism in Italy to managing a startup in Australia.

Now that I have refined my communication and managerial qualities, I would like to put by investigative mind to good use in a more specialised skill. Enter, Makers Academy. This 14 week intensive course will serve to cultivate the coding skills that I have been teaching myself for the past 6 months, and get me ready to be the developer I was born to be. Problem solving, creativity and logic are just some the traits that draw me to this profession and give me an eagerness to get stuck in.


## Skills

#### Communication

Written, verbal, non-verbal. You name it, I've got it.
Communications was a huge part of my bachelors degree and easily my favourite topic. Whether it was sculpting press releases to get key messages across or communicating with teams to organise group projects, I loved being a bridge for information.

Communication has also been an important skill in my previous jobs. In management roles I utilised verbal communication to keep employees engaged. Whereas during my internships, I needed to hone [my written skills](https://blog.studentsville.it/author/amir-aldean/) to engage an audience.

#### Creativity

Having been cursed with an artists' brain and builders' hands, I have had to turn to more clinical mediums of expressing myself. Such channels include [photograph](https://www.instagram.com/mellomelonjuice/?hl=en), [written prose](https://blog.studentsville.it/in_florence/best-cocktails-bitter-bar-florence-italy-review/) and [campaign creation](http://mellodrinks.co.uk/escape-the-ordinary-win-a-gopro-camera/).

I have also taken an interest in [videography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWgON8d9CaM) during my internships. Despite my amateur status it seems my enjoyment of pointing and shooting along with playing around with editors, is worth at at least a few thousand views.
