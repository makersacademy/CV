## Matt Zimmer

I am a determined and driven aspiring full-stack developer with a background in engineering and geology. I am looking to join a team in a positive and supportive environment where principles such as TDD are followed and where a growth mindset is encouraged.

#### Me at a glance

Aspiring junior developer; amateur background in developing video-game plugins (+7 years); professional background in healthcare advertising (+5 years). Recently graduated from the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) bootcamp; excited to join a friendly, ambitious team that will support me as I continue to grow and improve as a developer.

#### How I got here

Through my self-taught hobby of developing video game plugins (aka mods), I discovered a love for wrestling with a programming language to make my ideas a reality. Disatisfied with healthcare advertising, I left my Account Director role in 2021 to develop my hobby-acquired skills into a more fulfilling, stimulating and challenging career in software development.

After several months of self-directed learning, I joined [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) to improve my amateur coding skills for use in a professional context, and to learn new skills and langauages to make me a desirable candidate for a future employer. I am now ready for a junior developer role. I am determined and hungry for the challenge, and I am so excited to get started.

![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Zimmja)

In 2021, I was bored as an Account Director in a healthcare advertising agency. I wanted a more fulfilling career where I could use my creative problem solving skills for more than just project management. I wanted an intellectually stimulating challenge and to actually create something, not simply help others be creative. So I left.

For over 7 years, most of my creative fulfillment has come from my self-taught hobby of developing video game plugins (aka mods). I love wrestling with a programming language to make my ideas a reality, and this hobby has let me do that and achieve success (with 1.6 million downloads across 8 mods). When I left advertising, I was pleased to discover the similarity between the coding language I was using (Papyrus) and other object-orientated languages like JavaScript. I realised my hobby-acquired skills could lead me to a career in software development that would fulfill my needs.

After several months of learning to code through self-directed learning, I joined Makers Academy to improve my amateur coding skills for use in a professional context, and to learn new skills and langauages to make me a desirable candidate for a future employer. I am now ready for a junior developer role. I am determined and hungry for the challenge, and I am so excited to get started.
