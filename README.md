## Lilly Daniell


I am an ambitious, organised and creative full-stack junior developer (in-training!). I am looking for a role where I can extend my programming knowledge and gain business development experience, while contributing to well-designed, useful tech.

I have worked in the contemporary art world for the last decade as an Exhibitions Manager. I've worked in galleries and museums in Berlin, New York and London. This career let me work with many different people on exciting large-scale projects, facilitating artists and delivering exhibitions within tight deadlines. Driven by curiosity, possibility, and a desire to keep learning, I'm learning to code at Makers Acedemy to create and build something, and to challenge myself.
