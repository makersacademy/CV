## Skills

#### Quick Learner
- Now that I am developing and maintaining software, my enthusiasm is boundless. I am eager to learn as much as possible   and continue improving as a developer. I am excited to work on new challenges, gain new knowledge and use my existing 
skills to enhance my future projects. 

#### Adaptable and control
- Since I have joined Makers I learned to be Adaptable, as my learning environment was getting changed every day and I had to cope and control the situation to progress forward and achieve my goals on time.

#### Team-Player
- I genuinely enjoy working with others, learning and teaching at the same time  are always great motivators for creating high-quality  projects. The Makers course led us to work on individual and joint projects, and I was comfortable with either arrangement. One of my strengths is ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to put forward their ideas so that we identify the best solution most effectively.

#### detail-oriented
- I'm well organised and pay attention to all details such as major or minor ,The ability to be detail-oriented build up with practice in me during my years of painting and now programming.

I have passion for cooking .I cook every day,my grand_mum was my inspiration at first. I was amazed how she managed to pull out the best taste out of ingredients .After I moved to uk Jamie Oliver opened my eyes to new cooking style since then I like to try different spices with new ingredients to create new tastes.
