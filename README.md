#### Me at a glance

Aspiring junior developer; amateur background in developing video-game plugins (+7 years); professional background in healthcare advertising (+5 years). Recently graduated from the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) bootcamp; excited to join a friendly, ambitious team that will support me as I continue to grow and improve as a developer.

#### How I got here

Through my self-taught hobby of developing video game plugins (aka mods), I discovered a love for wrestling with a programming language to make my ideas a reality. Disatisfied with healthcare advertising, I left my Account Director role in 2021 to develop my hobby-acquired skills into a more fulfilling, stimulating and challenging career in software development.

After several months of self-directed learning, I joined [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) to improve my amateur coding skills for use in a professional context, and to learn new skills and langauages to make me a desirable candidate for a future employer. I am now ready for a junior developer role. I am determined and hungry for the challenge, and I am so excited to get started.

### Featured Makers Challenges

During my time at Makers Academy, I completed several pair-programming and solo challenges. The ones I felt were most educational and enjoyable are listed here.
| Name | Aims |Description | Tech/Tools |
|--|--|--|--|
| [**Acebook**](https://github.com/Zimmja/acebook-blue-magpies) | Use a framework to develop a full-stack web-app | For this group engineering challenge, we built a simple social media web-app based on Facebook which allowed users to create a basic profile and comment on other users' profiles | Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, Capybara, Selenium Webdriver, Rspec, Rubocop, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Heroku|
| [**Banking**](https://github.com/Zimmja/Makers-challenge-Bank) | Practice writing well-crafted code to solve a technical problem | For this technical solo challenge, I had the chance to craft my own code and to practice making it easily readable, understandable, and editable for a coach review. I was pleased to pass this challenge on my first attempt | JavaScript, Node, Jest, Prettier |
| [**Bowling**](https://github.com/Zimmja/Makers-challenge-Thermostat) | To convert code from one language to another (i.e. Ruby to JavaScript) | For this solo challenge, I was tasked with creating a scoring card for a bowling game. This was deceptively difficult, and I really enjoyed designing the logic and writing the code to calculate the scoring. Once completed in Ruby, I converted it to JavaScript, which I had less experience with at the time | JavaScript, Ruby, Node, Jest, Rspec |
| [**Thermostat**](https://github.com/Zimmja/Makers-challenge-Thermostat) | Create and test-drive a simple JavaScript program using Node | For this pairing challenge, we created a thermostat that could be interacted with via the command line and utilise API calls from OpenWeather | JavaScript, Node, Jest, APIs |
| [**RPS Game**](https://github.com/Zimmja/Makers-challenge-RPS) | Create a game that is playable in a web browser | For this solo challenge, I was tasked with creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) style game. I particularly enjoyed this challenge because I finished quickly and was able to stretch myself to a 16-item game (instead of the 3-item RPS game) | Ruby, Sinatra, Capybara, Selenium Webdriver, HTML, CSS, Rspec, Rubocop|

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Zimmja&layout=compact)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

In 2021, I was bored as an Account Director in a healthcare advertising agency. I wanted a more fulfilling career where I could use my creative problem solving skills for more than just project management. I wanted an intellectually stimulating challenge and to actually create something, not simply help others be creative. So I left.

For over 7 years, most of my creative fulfillment has come from my self-taught hobby of developing video game plugins (aka mods). I love wrestling with a programming language to make my ideas a reality, and this hobby has let me do that and achieve success (with 1.6 million downloads across 8 mods). When I left advertising, I was pleased to discover the similarity between the coding language I was using (Papyrus) and other object-orientated languages like JavaScript. I realised my hobby-acquired skills could lead me to a career in software development that would fulfill my needs.

After several months of learning to code through self-directed learning, I joined Makers Academy to improve my amateur coding skills for use in a professional context, and to learn new skills and langauages to make me a desirable candidate for a future employer. I am now ready for a junior developer role. I am determined and hungry for the challenge, and I am so excited to get started.
