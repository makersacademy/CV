## Tom Coakes

I'm a budding coder with a somewhat redundant Linguistics degree from the University of Kent. I have several years of commercial experience in a number of industries, during which time I've made enough wrong decisions to now know how to make the right ones. More than anything else, I'm looking for a company that will help me to continue my journey of learning and allow me to make valuable contributions within a team that 'clicks'.
