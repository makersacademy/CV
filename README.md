## Raefe Newton-Jones

I am a Data Engineer with a particular interest in helping companies to turn machine learning models into functional pieces of software. The most enjoyable aspect of coding for me is writing a beautiful piece of code which is efficient, succinct and accessible. I love automating, in every arena possible.


## Projects
| Project  | Summary | Technologies |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|1. [Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/Raefey/FinalProjectML)  | Our final project at Makers Academy which explored Machine Learning. We created bots to detect cancerous tumours and diabetes. Going into the week with no experience in machine learning by the end of the week we were able to test drive all the bots with 100% coverage  | Python, Unittest, Tensorflow |
|2. [Acebook](https://github.com/Raefey/acebook-dart)  | A two week group project to create a clone of Facebook  | Ruby on Rails, RSpec, JQuery, Postgres, Heroku  |
|3. [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/Raefey/bank-tech-test)  | A practice tech test, simulating a Bank, focusing on the bank statement  | Ruby, RSpec |
|4. [Bowling Challenge](https://github.com/Raefey/bowling-challenge)  | A bowling-score calculator, I was proud of this project as I used a really interesting recurring method  | Javascript, Jasmine |
|5. [Thermostat](https://github.com/Raefey/thermostat-challenge)  | A simulation of a Thermostat, with an interactive web page, built in my first week of Javascript  | Javascript, Jasmine, JQuery  |
|6. [Oystercard Challenge](https://github.com/Raefey/oystercard)  | The content of my second week of the Makers Academy course, a simulation of the Oystercard system  | Ruby, RSpec  |

## Skills

#### Problem Solving


I've always prided myself on my ability to be pragmatic.
I have a particular strength in Maths and from a young age have enjoyed solving really difficult mathematical problems.
In the final project at Makers Academy I faced many high-level coding challenges. With no prior knowledge of Machine Learning I was able to test-drive three machine learning models.
One particular project I'm proud of is building an entire data pipeline; integrating legacy APIs with new technologies to create a ward reporting function for hospitals.

#### Communication

In year 12 at school I was part of the Young Enterprise Program. I was voted by my peers and year 13 to represent the company as Managing Director which involved public speaking, and management of the team.  
At University I was made vice captain of the City Water Polo Team in Dundee within the first few weeks playing for the club.

#### Unstoppable

You won't often find people raving about the fact they dropped out of university posted all over their CVs. Leaving University was a difficult decision for me, it left me in London with no qualifications, job or financial support. Being completely independent since the age of 19, I've had to work hard to get to where I am today and have absolutely no desire to stop now. When I set myself a task there is little or nothing that will stand in my way.
