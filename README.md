A passionate Software Engineer who brings a unique and valuable IT skill set. This is through a combination of proven technical skills delivering web solutions with Rails and a wealth of IT project experience and communication skills from being a Software Tester of 9 years.

### Skills for the job
#### Software Engineer
A fast learner of new technologies who thoroughly enjoys being challenged.

* Ruby on Rails:
  - Full Stack Rails developer at Zopa. Working in an agile team we designed and implemented a replacement debt collection system for defaulted loans. Comfortable working on front-end or back-end solutions.
  - Delivered a solution with Sidekiq to run pdf letter generation as a background job. This resulted in a significant performance gain and decoupled pdf generation out into its own area, adding new letter templates is now significantly easier.
  - Moved the whole application (NginX, PSQL, Redis and the Rails app) into Docker containers which made deployments extremely easy. Created a makefile so the team could spin up dev, testing and staging environments with a single command. A major benefit is that we can test our code using the exact same setup as production.
* Javascript experience, an example was to use AJAX to refresh a list of letters as they were created.
* Pair programming:
  - Enjoys pairing with other developers and at Zopa it helped to quickly build up system knowledge, hear new ideas and ultimately clear and correct code. Also the constant reviewing of each others code sped up the release process.
* Test Driven Development:
  - 9 years of Software Testing has allowed for hands on involvement in requirements gathering and final deployment to end users. As a Software Engineer these end user/business insights help in the construction of well focused Rspec unit tests and Capybara end-to-end tests to then code from. Coding example with Rspec tests  [best-rate loan matcher](https://github.com/meads58/best_rate)
* DevOps mindset:
  - Proactive to find ways to help other teams so we can continuously deploy. Added in logging to our Rails app for splunk logging, hipchat notification from jenkins on build statuses and Docker, Vagrant, Puppet and Artifactory for our project's configuration management solution.
  - Worked in the platform team on deployment solutions using Docker, Vagrant, Puppet, Octopus, Jenkins and Artifactory tools for the legacy systems at Zopa. This will allow for a quick spin up of identical environments on any machine and the removal of bottlenecks in the current deployment process.

#### Communication
Excellent, clear and concise communication skills.
* Business and Developer communication:
  - Excellent skills at bridging the communication gap between business and technical audiences built form the years spent as a tester liaising between developers and business users.
* Question asking:
  - Not afraid to ask for clarification early on which ensures focus is set to solve the correct problems.

#### Problem Solving
Breaking down problems into manageable chunks, attention to detail and designing solutions that integrate well.

* Define the problem:
  - Define the problem, break it down and look for any potential issues downstream. An example at Zopa was the creation of our process flow diagram for the new debt collection application. This served as the delivery road map, clearly showing upstream and down stream dependencies for each step which was expanded out and coded for.
* Innovation:
  -  Looking to improve/re-factor code for a genuine benefit. Example at Zopa with an opportunity to add needed flexibility of the 'on hold' feature. Instead of a solution to pause the Sidekiq queue, the queue time was made adjustable. This gave the users added flexibility for individual cases and also allowed them to simulate a full work flow in UAT.
* Planning and Design:
  - The [Battleship project](https://github.com/meads58/battleships/tree/master/lib)  project shows how the single responsibility principle was used to design the system. Achieved a clear understanding of building applications up from small manageable chunks to solve a specific problem led to making, maintaining and adding features easier.
