## Sam Broughton

I'm a full-stack developer, Makers Academy alumnus and passionate coder with experience in JavaScript, Ruby and C#. I'm also an amateur philosopher, TV fanatic and keen reader whose headlong stumble through life has accumulated many interests from experimental psychology to classical ballet. I'm currently looking for my first Graduate/Junior Developer role at an exciting company where I can continue to develop my coding skills alongside a great team! Please contact me at sjbroughton1@gmail.com if you think I'd be a good fit for your company!

## Skills

#### Fast learner
- For our Makers Academy final project: [Make It Stop! Alarm Clock](https://github.com/MakeItStop/task-based-alarm), my team and I wanted to challenge ourselves to learn a brand-new JavaScript framework not taught as part of the course. After some research into various options, we decided on NativeScript with Angular 2 and TypeScript. By the end of the 12-day project we had produced a fully operational app, which I've used as my personal alarm ever since!

#### Attentive to detail
- My previous job in an investment bank involved facilitating payments often worth upwards of a billion pounds' value in various currencies. Since one incorrect digit could result in huge financial losses and some very unhappy clients, I was inspired to develop an obsessive attention to detail.

#### Systematic thinker, problem solver
- My training in philosophy and formal logic at the University of Cambridge has helped immensely in my approach to coding, and allowed me to hone my ability to break down a problem systematically into distinct components.
