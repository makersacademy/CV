## About me

I'm a full-stack developer looking for an challenging new role in an exciting company. I've spent my career so far developing a broad knowledge base with the aim of gaining a robust overview of the full spectrum of web development. Now that I feel I've (sufficiently) achieved this goal, I want to push my skills to the next level and gain deeper understanding by joining an active and thriving company with a passionate community of developers to learn from and to mentor.

I've put together a couple of example projects, linked below, to demonstrate the current state of my knowledge and preferred tech stack. However, my aim in assembling a Docker- and Microservice-based stack was to remain as implementation-agnostic as possible, as I am extremely keen to continue to learn and adopt new languages, frameworks and technologies!
