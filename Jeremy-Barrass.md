# Jeremy Barrass

A dreamer and idealistic visionary who wants to go ahead and make it real anyway, to truly test the limits of the possible.  I have always had a vibrant and colourful inner world, to both conquer and thought experiment in.  I've recently learned a lot about how to interact with computers at a level where I can build virtually anything my imagination might conceive.  I now feel there's the real possiblity that I can leave the world a better place than I found it.  I would love to contribute this potential to the space industry, such as ESA's EXOMars Rover or the Sentinel Satellite programme, where I can take part in our expansion outward into the cosmos.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Enjoy solving puzzles and problems and have become very adroit at doing so, particularly during my time	at Makers Academy.

* Regularly solved problems of information provision and dissemination amoung colleagues and service users in previous roles: created crib sheets and instructional documents to summarise key information, improving workflow efficiency.

* Practised solving myriad software development problems over the duration of the course at Makers Academy.  Worked with fellow cohort members to refactor and pass failing tests, configure test and development environments, and generate and develop project ideas, generating a broad variety of github repos.

* Engage in board games, computer games and pen-and-paper rpgs, promoting strategic thinking, conflict resolution and teamwork.  This includes a weekly Pathfinder gaming group through Dragons on the Hill, and recently joining the Magic: the Gathering group at Makers Academy.

#### Designing: Analysis, Planning & Research

Adept with managing the design process: breaking down processess and systems into components, to better understand how the whole fits together; building out step-by-step to achieve a goal, in a way which others may easily follow; and gathering the relevant information to inform these two elements effectively.
